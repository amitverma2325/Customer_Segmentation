                                                Customer Segmentation Analysis

Customer segmentation is a way to split customers into groups based on certain characteristics that those customers share. All customers share the common need of your product or service, but beyond that, there are distinct demographic differences (i.e., age, gender) and they tend to have additional socio-economic, lifestyle, or other behavioral differences that can be useful to the organization.

In this project i have calculated RFM scores and then applied KMeans clustering and found the no of optimized clusters.

This project involve following steps.

Firstally i have dealt with cleaning and preprocessing of the data removing inconcistencies from the data like checking null values duplicates and handling null values and dropping irrelevant data.

Secondally I do Visualization of variables through different chart.

In the third part I calculated RFM scores and applied KMeans Clustering The project conclude that KMeans clustering on Recency, Frequency and Monetary data gives us the best result with the optimal number of clusters as 3. We can use this model to cluster our data in 3 segments and develop better marketing strategies.
